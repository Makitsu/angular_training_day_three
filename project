Create a simple weather application that displays the current weather information for a given location.

The application should have two routes: a Home route and a Weather route.

The Home route should display a form where the user can enter a location (e.g. city, state, or ZIP code) and submit the form to navigate to the Weather route.

The Weather route should display the current weather information for the location that was entered on the Home route.

You can use a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack to get the weather information.

Create a guard that prevents the user from navigating to the Weather route if they haven't entered a location on the Home route.

Add a navigation button to the Weather page that allows the user to go back to the Home page and enter a new location.

Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing.
